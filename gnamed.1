.sp
A script (\fBgnamed\fP) to download gene/protein name records, bootstrap a
database to store them, and load the gene/protein names into that datastore,
unifying the names across multiple repositories into single, species\-specific
gene and protein records with their references to PubMed IDs. The datastore
differentiates between names and symbols, and contains keywords relevant for
each protein and gene. For genes, their chromosome and location (band) is
stored, while for proteins their weight and length is maintained. The main
("official") name and symbol for each originating repository is retained and
all genes/proteins are linked to their species ID. The references to PubMed
abstracts are collected from the Entrez and UniProt records. For UniProt
records, in addition, all known (i.e. incl. earlier, outdated) accessions are
stored as a entity string with the category key (\fBprotein_strings.cat\fP)
\fB"accession"\fP\&.

\fBImportant:\fP The order in which repositories are loaded \fIdoes\fP matter,
particularly for setting gene and protein metadata (chromosome, location,
length, mass). The last repository loaded will always overwrite this metadata.
So it is advisable to first load the generic repositories (Entrez, UniProt)
and only then load the specific ones (HGNC, MGD, RGD, etc.) to set the "true"
metadata.
.SH TAXONOMY
.sp
The NCBI Taxonomy is used as the main \fBspecies\fP reference. As some databases
are not always up\-to\-date, in addition to the default nodes (and their names),
the merged nodes are added, too. This allows mapping of many out\-dated TaxIDs
to the relevant (current) species. All (outdated) NCBI TaxIDs that have
been merged into new nodes are added to the \fBspecies\fP table, using the merge
target as their parent_id and with the constant value "\fBmerged\fP" in the
\fIrank\fP attribute, that normally qualifies the type of node. However, there are
records that have no known mapping to the NCBI Taxonomy (and despite being
qualified as NCBI TaxIDs) in some databases. These references to "unknown"
species are all re\-mapped to the NCBI node for unknown species (NCBI TaxID
\fB32644\fP). For example, in TrEMBL (UniProt), this is the case for about 60
species IDs and their associated proteins.
.sp
The \fBspecies_names\fP table contains all names for a given node, using the
attribute \fIcat\fP to qualify the type of name (e.g., "\fBcommon name\fP").
.SH FAST LOADING
.sp
Given that loading \fBEntrez Gene\fP and \fBUniProt\fP can take a very long time
(days or weeks) if they are loaded using the default mechanism, a fast DB
dump mechanism (using "\fBCOPY FROM\fP stream") is available for those DBs,
circumventing the ORM and its dreadful \fBINSERT\fP statements. These dumps are
implemented directly with the underlying DB drivers. Therefore, only the
following DBs are currently supported with fast loading:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
PostgreSQL (suffix \-pg; driver: \fBpsycopg2\fP)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To use fast loading, the first repository to load into a just initialized
database (i.e., only containing the NCBI Taxonomy) must be Entrez. Then the
two UniProt files may be fast\-loaded and finally all other repositories should
be added in any preferred order. To activate the fast loader instead of the
regular Parser/ORM mechanism, append the suffix \fBpg\fP to the repository key,
e.g., to fast load Entrez into a Postgres DB use:
\fBgnamed load entrezpg gene2pubmed gene_info\fP\&.
.sp
Note that if you decide to use SQLight as your DB, the way the ORM dumps data
into it is nearly as quick as using \fBCOPY FROM\fP stream. Therefore, for this
particular DB, fast loading is probably not an issue.
.SH TRUNCATING UNIPROT FILES
.sp
Particularly loading the TrEMBL data can be daunting, because the corresponding
UniProt flatfile dump is huge (several GB \fIcompressed\fP). To reduce the size of
the UniProt data, all unnecessary lines can be removed from the dump files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
zcat uniprot_trembl.dat.gz | grep "^\e(ID\e|AC\e|DE\e|GN\e|OX\e|RX\e|DR\e|KW\e|SQ\e|//\e)" > uniprot_trembl.min.dat
